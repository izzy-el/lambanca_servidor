This was an assignment for SI100 (2021). The idea here was to make sure students had understood the concepts behind arrays and multi-dimensional arrays and problem solving.

At this year, I was not taking the class. I solved this in order to help a friend. I am pretty sure there is a better way to do this, and I will probably try to implement a better solution, paying more attention to time complexity and algorithms efficiency.
